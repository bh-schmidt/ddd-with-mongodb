# DDD With MongoDB

Hi this is a simple example of how implement MongoDB in DDD, although many says that the Domain layer should not reference the Data layer, I don't like to follow the DDD by the book, I thing there is no silver bullet that solve all the problems, that's because I don't follow it.
